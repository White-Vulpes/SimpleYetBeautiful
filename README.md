# SimpleYetBeautiful

If you just want to preview the website and not test the functionalities. Its been hosted on Github Pages Here's the link https://white-vulpes.github.io/SimpleYetBeautiful/

The server for this website is in another repo https://github.com/White-Vulpes/ExpressHasuraAPI

It can be tested only locally so run the index.js in above given repo and run the index.html in this repo. And everthing should hopefully work fine.

The database is in cloud so no issues in setting it up.

Hope you like my project..
